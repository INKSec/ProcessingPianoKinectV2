# ProcessingPianoKinectV2
A small project where you can control a piano with your hands

## To run this sketch you have to create a data folder inside the procesing sketch and add the calibri font and seven piano sounds ##


## Installation ##

The following instructions refer to Windows 10.

### Processing ###

Processing 4.0 was used as the development environment.
The program can be downloaded free of charge from the Processing.org website.
In Processing the libraries Sound and KinectPV2 have to be installed.
This is done via the tab Tools -> Manage Tools -> Libraries...
The sound files are not in the attached Git repository. If no sound files with the same name are added to the program, it crashes.

### KinectV2 ###

A USB 3.0 port is required to run the camera.
The KinectPV2 Library requires the official Microsoft KinectSDK in order to display a skeleton. The SDK can be found quickly and easily via Microsoft's download center.
In order for the Kinect camera to be recognized, the UsbDk driver must be installed. The current release can be found on Github. 
https://github.com/daynix/UsbDk/releases
Inside the installation folder of the SDKs is the SDK 2.0 browser.
If this is started, it is possible to test the functionality of the Kinect camera using examples.
